# Markbase
Markbase is an application made in C# that uses a Microsoft Access database where teachers can store student's marks. After logging in, the admin can search for a student to look up their grades, displayed on a graph, and edit them as well as add or delete students from the class if needed. Additionally, each student's mark can be compared to the overall average of the class. 

The application is made using Windows Form to create a GUI for the user to be able to clearly locate all the information needed from the student.  SQL quarries are used to alter the database as well as extracting the information needed for the interface.
