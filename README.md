# Markbase
Markbase is an application made in C# that uses a Microsoft Access database where teachers can store students marks. After logging in, the admin is able to search for a student to look up their grades, which are displayed on a graph, and edit them if needed. Each student's mark can be compared to the overall average of the class. 

The application is made using Windows Form to create a the GUI for the user to be able to clearly locate all the information needed from the student.Additionally, the admin is able to add or delete students from the class. The application uses SQL quarries to alter the database as well as extracting the information needed for the interface.
